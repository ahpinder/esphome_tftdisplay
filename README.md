# esphome_tftdisplay
Add Adafruit 160x128 TFT color display to esphome

This is based on some work found here: https://github.com/airy10/esphome-m5stickC

All I did was make this work with the 160x128 display from Adafruit, and provide a sample config file - not much.

To use, add the project files to /config/esphome/ 

You will need to fetch the font file and put it in that same folder.
